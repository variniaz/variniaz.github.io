## Overview

BLP Team App is a web-based application that includes a human resource information system, performance management system for employees, meeting room and vehicle reservation system. In this project, I was responsible for creating and developing a restful API that would be consumed by frontend developers.

## Core Features

- **Role-based Authentication:** using JWT, role-based authentication used for some endpoints
- **Dashboard Management:** handled the API including user management, and data management for admin role.
- **Reservation System**: created API for reservation system that include meeting room and vehicle reservation.
- **Performance Management System**: created API for a tool that manages and evaluate performance of the employees. Using custom mechanism and custom formula for calculating KPI and Goals of the company.

## Impacts

- This REST API **has been consumed** by Frontend Developer of BLP Beauty, and the app has been used for employee’s daily basis work.
- This app **helped HR Manager** in terms of Human Resource and 90+ employees on their daily basis works.
- The reservation system helps the work process become more efficient, which previously used spreadsheets, now with an integrated reservation system.
