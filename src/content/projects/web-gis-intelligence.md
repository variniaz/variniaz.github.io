## Overview

A web-based GIS Application, that includes dashboard for user and package management. In this project, I contributed more to the dashboard (especially package settings) and circle analysis. Abbauf WebGIS Intelligence is a portfolio project of the company.

### Core Features I Contributed To

- **Dashboard - User Management:** a feature that includes registration, authentication, and management of user permissions. Users can set personal profiles, manage passwords, and are granted appropriate access permissions
- **Dashboard - Package Settings:** allow admins to manage subscription packages for users, and manage custom subscriptions for users according to their needs.
- **Dashboard - SHP Management:** allow user and admin to upload their own SHP file, to maximize the WebGIS analysis.
- **WebGIS:** allos users to do grid analysis and circle analysis. The web app also allow users to make a survey based on WebGIS data.
