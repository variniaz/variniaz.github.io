## Overview

Tixfly is an Indonesian-based event management and ticketing platform designed to be a "360-degree ecosystem" for event organizers.

Unlike traditional ticket aggregators that simply list events, Tixfly focuses on providing a comprehensive suite of tools for the behind-the-scenes management of concerts, sports, and festivals.

Tixfly is often used for high-profile events in Indonesia that require complex logistics, such as the Jakarta Running Festival, Jakarta Fashion Week, RunWMe 2024, and various music concerts. It is operated under PT Multi Way Solution (sister brand of PT Mari Works Solution

## Core Features I've Contributed On

### Ticketing Queue

- This feature may not be very visible to users, but on the backend it acts as a complex traffic controller, managing data flow to ensure nothing is lost and that the most urgent issues are handled first.
- I contributed on developing the queue system, especially on ticketing transaction with big traffics.
- The queue system handled more than 270,000 transactions.

### Dynamic Seating Plan

- One of the core features allows clients to create a seating plan for each event, with their own custom seating layout.
- I contributed to the backend system, including dashboard requirements and handling customer transactions related to seat selection.
- This seating-plan system has been used in several large-scale events, with up to ___ participants per event.

### Ticket Handover & Delegation

- **Ticket Handover**: a feature that allows formal process of transferring responsibility for an active ticket from one ticket owner to another.
- **Ticket Delegation:** a feature that allows customers to delegate a ticket to another person, enabling the delegated user to use the ticket within a specified time period. This feature is commonly used for race pack collection.
- I contributed to this core feature, focusing on ensuring that the data used throughout the process remains reliable and valid.
