## Core Features I've Contributed On

### Ticketing Queue

- This feature may not be very visible to users, but on the backend it acts as a complex traffic controller, managing data flow to ensure nothing is lost and that the most urgent issues are handled first.
- I contributed on developing the queue system, especially on ticketing transaction with big traffics.
- The queue system handled more than 270,000 transactions.

### Dynamic Seating Plan

- One of the core features allows clients to create a seating plan for each event, with their own custom seating layout.
- I contributed to the backend system, including dashboard requirements and handling customer transactions related to seat selection.
- This seating-plan system has been used in several large-scale events, with up to ___ participants per event.

### Ticket Handover & Delegation

- **Ticket Handover**: a feature that allows formal process of transferring responsibility for an active ticket from one ticket owner to another.
- **Ticket Delegation:** a feature that allows customers to delegate a ticket to another person, enabling the delegated user to use the ticket within a specified time period. This feature is commonly used for race pack collection.
- I contributed to this core feature, focusing on ensuring that the data used throughout the process remains reliable and valid.
